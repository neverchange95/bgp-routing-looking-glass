The primary functionality of this file is to serve as the main entry point for the React application. 
It sets up routing using the HashRouter from the "react-router-dom" library, defining routes for the 
Home and Looking Glass pages. The application structure includes components for Home and Looking Glass, 
which are rendered based on the specified routes.

import {
    HashRouter as Router,
    Route, Routes
} from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./pages/home";
import LookingGlass from "./pages/looking-glass";

function App() {
  return (
      <Router>
          <Routes>
            <Route exact path='/' element={<Home/>}/>
            <Route exact path="/looking-glass" element={<LookingGlass/>}/>
          </Routes>
      </Router>
